              <p>Hey! My name is Lorenzo Bacchus, I’m from a small Caribbean island called St. Vincent and the Grenadines and I’m 29 years old. </p>

               <p>Since I was a child I have worked alongside my father on different construction sites. Seeing how hard he worked made me develop a passion for Architecture. In my mind, if I were to become an Architect, and start my own firm, I would be able to allow my father to rest.</p>
                
               <p>My architectural beliefs are simple. I believe that buildings should be designed not just for function, but also to inspire people. Additionally, I believe that as technology progresses, so should Architecture. Buildings should be designed with the future in mind, just as technology is.</p>
                
                <p>But, Architecture is not my only interest. I also have a great interest in team sports because they teach you how to be more disciplined, patient, respectful, honest, loving; and they help bridge the communication gap between individuals. When you have fun together doing something you love, all tension and reservations disappear.</p>
                
                <p>In Architecture, these skills become especially important in teaching us how we should respond to a site, its surroundings, and its users.
